Bitcoin vs S&P500 Volatility Analysis (Excel Project)

Manuela, the Head of Finance, requested an analysis of Bitcoin’s performance to decide whether it could be a good investment. Her main concern was volatility, so she asked for a comparison against the S&P500, along with clear statistics, PivotTables, and visualizations.

🔧 What I Did

Imported and cleaned both datasets using Power Query

Standardized dates, added “Symbol” labels, removed null values

Merged both datasets into one consolidated table for analysis

Calculated key metrics:
max, min, average, % differences, standard deviation

Used XLOOKUP to find the exact date of each asset’s highest & lowest values

Built a monthly standard deviation PivotTable to measure volatility over time

Created visualizations:

📉 Line chart (volatility trends)

📦 Box & whisker chart (overall variation)

Converted formulas to static values using a simple macro

Prepared the workbook for delivery

📊 Final Insights (Answer to the Prompt)

Bitcoin shows high potential upside but extremely high volatility

Its volatility does not stabilize month-to-month — it's unpredictable

The S&P500 is much more stable, with low volatility and consistent behavior

Overall: Bitcoin may offer strong returns, but carries significantly higher risk compared to the S&P500
